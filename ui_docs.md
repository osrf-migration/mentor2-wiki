# User Interface (UI) #

![m2_v1_ui.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/qAj6BE/images/2938429436-m2_v1_ui.png)

### A: Component Palette (top) ###
The left column is the Component Palette. Use this section to add components to the scene. Simply navigate to the desired component, click, and drag to the right (D or E).

Breadcrumbs at the top of this section help you navigate back up through the component library.

### B: Component Palette (bottom) ###
The bottom section displays component properties. Click on a component in the top section to see its properties below. You may edit the properties before adding the component to the scene. 

**Note**: This will not overwrite the default properties for future use. 

### C: Toolbar ###
**The left-most group of icons contains manipulation controls.**

![arrow_small.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/qAj6BE/images/990512632-arrow_small.png) View mode navigates in 3D View. Left mouse click pans. Scroll wheel zooms. Click scroll wheel to rotate view. 

![translate_small.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/qAj6BE/images/318305491-translate_small.png) Translate mode to translate components in 3D View. Click on component and use translate markers. 

**Note:** You can also use "x", "y", or "z" hot keys to translate along that axis. 

![rotate_small.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/qAj6BE/images/3715820262-rotate_small.png) Rotate mode to rotate components in 3D View. Click on component and use rotate markers. 

**Note:** You can also use "x", "y", or "z" hot keys to rotate along that axis.

![scale_small.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/qAj6BE/images/4006329730-scale_small.png) Scale mode to scale components in 3D View. Click on component and use scale markers. 


** To the right of the manipulation controls is the connection control. **

![connector_small.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/qAj6BE/images/994190409-connector_small.png)  When in this mode, clicking on two components in the 3D View will snap them together, and create a fixed connection between the two. The second component to be selected is the target location. 

Note: This tool will be expanded in later versions. 

### D: Schematic View ###
This section displays a schematic representation of each component. Spatial positioning in this view is not indicative of a component's actual location relative to other components. Each component comes with a set of relevant "ports" that can be used to connect one component to another. 

Use the Schematic View to:

• Gain a high level view of your design and its individual components 

• Connect components (with wire, for example)

### E: 3D View ###
This section displays components in 3D. 

Use the 3D View to:

• Spatially position components in relation to one another

• Rotate, translate and scale components

• View how components react when you run the simulation 

### F: Control Panel ###
Below the 3D View is the Control Panel. 

Use the Control Panel to:

• Pause/Play physics

• Step through the simulation in specific increments, or "steps" 

• View the Real Time Factor, Simulation Time, and Real Time

• View the number of iterations that the physics engine have taken.

• Reset the simulation
